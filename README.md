# Monoped-Repo
Whale Shark Rig

This project is to learn how to rig a monoped character. I started off with some drawings of a stylized whale shark character and modeled it in Maya and ZBrush. I then UV mapped it in Maya and exported it into Substance Painter 3D so I could apply textures to the model.
